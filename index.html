                    <h3>The Great Sea</h3>
                    <p>The Great Sea is home to six major islands: The Oaken Enclave, The Ashen Isle, The Twin-Peaked Skerry, The Drowned Holm, The Frosted Chain, and The Withered Cay. Each boasts its own distinct biome, culture, and natural resources. Denizens of these islands rarely leave their native land, as the waters of the Great Sea are dangerous and unforgiving. Beneath the surface all manner of creatures lay in wait for those foolish enough to pass through their domain. </p>

                    <h3>Akupara</h3>
                    <p>For as long as most can remember, the gargantuan sea turtle Akupara has been circling the Great Sea, only briefly resting at each island before continuing its journey. None know why it does so, but shrewd individuals saw its pattern as an opportunity to connect the inhabitants of the world. At first, only a courageous few resided upon its back in hastily built tents, trading unique resources from their own island for those of others. Over time, the demand for trade and safe passage grew. In order to keep up, the entrepreneurs on Akuparaâ€™s back created Sanctuary, the first and only travelling city.</p>

                    <h3>Sanctuary</h3>
                    <p>Sanctuary is the melting pot of the Great Sea. There, the best and brightest from the six islands combine their resources and ingenuity to push the boundaries of science and magic. Aside from those who work in the city, only the wealthy or the incredibly skilled are allowed passage from one island to the next. Recently, a Task Force has been formed to solve issues on each of the islands as they are visited. The players take on this role.</p>

                <p><strong>Bio:</strong> Minalan Embercrest was raised on the Oaken Enclave. The only son of prominent politicians, he spent most of his childhood sequestered in the massive library. At the tender young age of 75 he was apprenticed to Master Thinradel, who noticed a spark of arcane power, and sought to have it flourish. For the next 25 years, he split his time between his training, and his research into various bits of lore and legend. Upon his 100th naming day, he announced that as an adult, he would set off in search of the fabled Elastin Stones. He joined the Task Force, both as a means of using his training to be used for the betterment of his fellow humanoids, and as a means of searching the other islands of the Great Sea to find the Stones.</p>
